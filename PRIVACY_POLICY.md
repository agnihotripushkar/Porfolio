**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

## Introduction
The **System Design Interview Pacer** ("Extension") is a browser extension designed to help users pace their system design interviews. This Privacy Policy describes how the Extension collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.**

*   **No Remote Transmission**: The Extension runs entirely on your local device (client-side). No data is transmitted to any external server.
*   **No Analytics**: We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking cookies.
*   **No User Accounts**: The Extension does not require a user account or login.

## Local Storage permissions
The Extension makes use of the Chrome `storage` API (specifically `chrome.storage.local`) for the sole purpose of:
*   **Persisting State**: Saving the current timer value and phase so that if you accidentally refresh the page, your interview timer does not reset.

This data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.

## Third-Party Access
Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.
